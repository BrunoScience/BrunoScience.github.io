# The Autodidactic DISCIPLINE ... NO EXCUSES!

This exercise in 100 days of learning is really just about scratching the surface ... it's about developing an awareness of everything we would need to do make executable graphcomputing happen ... it's not so much about the *journey itself* as much as it is about mapping out how we might go about that journey ... it's mostly about building the ***daily*** *little* **discipline** of continuously leveling up skills to be able learn about all of the infrastructure and dependencies that it takes to sustain any [autodidactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) program of study.

This 100 day deep dive *exercise* has to be a about particular, very specific topic. We can start with something like [*ab initio* quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) and how that background in skills that we develop in scientific high performance computing might help us do things [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry).  

We could also start with something else like optimizing [**Physics-informed** neural networks (PINN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/theory/phys_informed.html) to be more efficient in searching for or identifying compounds with properties we desire. OR ...instead of things like *ab initio* quantum chemistry OR PINN ... maybe we could looking at improved fixturing [for light sources as well as sensors, lenses, etc] to upcycle use [epifluorescence microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope) into [super-resolution microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_microscopy) or *pulling off little tricks* like [dSTORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_microscopy#Direct_stochastical_optical_reconstruction_microscopy_%28dSTORM%29) ... ultimately, that would probably involve adding ultraHDR, computer vision and delving into how AI and deep learning computational horsepower opens up new possibilities AND shows how our knowledge of fixturing, tool&die work is not quite adequate, ie the [autodidactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) scientist might have other options, ie *to just buy the damned gear*, but it does not hurt to understand the craft necessary blow the unique glassware to keep the lab advancing. 

The whole point of [autodidacticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) is about NOT having any tolerance for excuses or respect for boundaries.
