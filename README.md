# 100 Days of learning about graph compute and *ab initio* quantum chemistry methods

The general objective of this deep dive is about [*ab initio* quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) and [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) and that means not just learning, but really LEARNING about how to test, experiment and learn as we go ... to develop the skills of learning faster about things that can make one more productive. Active learning of this nature is fundamentally an exercise in the continuous improvement of diligent dogfooding -- we are mostly learning in order to learn in order to learn in order to learn ...  we use deep learning and computational horsepower to aid our learning about other things like computational chemistry and simulation, AI for computer-aided imaging at nanoscale and natural language processing for smarter ways to curate and annotate datagraphs of knowledge ... it's mostly about the discipline of continuously learning about learning.
