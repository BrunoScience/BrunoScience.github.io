# 100 Days of learning -- Day 10

Old-timers know why [*"It's [always] the COMMUNITY, stupid!"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid).

Modern development is about COMMUNITIES! COMMUNITIES! COMMUNITIES!

The **COMMUNITY** of **freely-extensible** open source software continues to eat the world.

Whereas propriety stuff only gives people featured-up bloatware, unnecessary expense, constant updating headaches and a constant stream of *hidden* latent, ie proprietary, vulnerabilities to information security disasters which feed on the population of fools who think they can just *buy* trustworthiness without having to ever think about what's really going on.

If you want to work with information technology in any degree of seriousness, you need to work on your toolchain and optimize the code of your tools *or at least have something resembling a clue about WTF is in there*. 

There's ***no*** *end* to the amount of "sharpening the saw" that is necessary for moving from high-level scripting and abstraction ... and on greater control with things like NEW C standards, C mastery including [the ncurses library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) and implementing ultra-fast, ultra-clean code with embedded intelligence or neural network search/find utilities in Rust. If you want to design in observability into your tools, you have to write your own databases or at least be in some semblance of control over the data structures ... *we plan to cover more on this particular topic on [Day 20](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/31/Day-20.html).*

This is why the smart people in the room know that they are not that smart by themselves ... it's why [*"It's [always] the COMMUNITY, stupid!"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid)
