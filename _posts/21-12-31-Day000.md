# 100 Days of learning -- Day 0

We learn in order to become better at the community and processes of learning ... shared practical learning is fundamentally what science is about. Science is a matter of community learning ... we do science in order to engage in the community of science.

Learning is based upon the scientific method or the larger super-community of genuine science -- it's about studying what others have learned, interacting with others who love discovering new things and generally leveling up everyone skills ... just as we learn best when explain what we have learned to others, we actually learn the material ourselves or we learn facets of a topic that did not originally occur to us when we use a computational approach or use machines to automate our [group] learning processes.

Computation is about improving our ability to deeply learn or to *misunderstand* at a deeper level.  Information is SURPRISE, not affirmation.

The learning development workflow ... involves automating the effectiveness of the structure of curated, annotated, scripted, automated learning ... but mostly, it is about more rapidly failing, more rapidly being humiliated by how little we actually understand.

### You will NEVER finish this pre-requisite lesson from Day 0

> The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings.
