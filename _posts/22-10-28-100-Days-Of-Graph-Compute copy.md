# 100 Days of learning about graph compute

We will want to do dive into [computational graphs](https://jdhao.github.io/2017/11/12/pytorch-computation-graph/) ... this will take us into the world of GPUs TPUs IPUs ... comparing the offerings of Paperspace, Lambda, VAST.ai, Colab, Kaggle, GCP, Azure, AWS ... and along the way it will require a bit of leveling up old school IT, sysadmin and C++ skills as well as trying to keep up with what's happening in containers, Jupyter notebooks, Python, PyTorch*


## The #100Days Plan 

1)  Setting Up The Learning Sandbox

2) The general objective of this deep dive is about LEARNING, learning how to learn about something that can make one more productive ... generally, we know that it is important to learn more about exercise and fitness in the use of things that one counts on everyday ... in this specific deep dive, we are interested in the process of learning about how we level up our skills in science and math to better USE deep learning.  

Active learning is fundamentally an exercise in the continuous improvement of diligent dogfooding -- it involves doing hands-on things directly, thinking in new compute paradigms as we upgrade our C++ skills, becoming familiar with new libraries, really using perfmon and debugging tools effectively and generally getting it absolutely right at each step compounds our ability to learn at the next steps that we cannot even currently foresee.  We will need to sharpen our skills in learning in new ways; it's a matter of developing the mental discipline to improve the ways that we teach ourselves to build the tools that we will use to build better tools to learn.

We want to use deep learning and computational horsepower to aid our learning about other things like computational chemistry and simulation, AI for computer-aided imaging at nanoscale and natural language processing for smarter ways to curate and annotate datagraphs of knowledge ... it's mostly about the discipline of continually learning.

In order to help ourselves learn, we will want to develop the content in some form of a collaborative online workspace ... that means Github Codespaces or GitPod.io or VScode.dev or some other browser-accessible, standard collaborative workspace that anyone with internet access can use  ... well, almost anyone ... this might involve training people somewhat or requesting that they [take their own deep dive into social Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive) as a precondition or prerequisite for collaboration.

20) Social media and social coding are about generating interactions and sharing ideas ... it's tough to say exactly where is the best place to find people, but you won't find people in your imagination or by just continuing to listen to the same people that you have listened to ... you will need to find your own ways to meet people ... it's like kindergarten; get out there and play with those kids ... and BE KIND!

80) This milestone is about the final push toward wrapping thing thing up ... after the 100 days are done, it's either a matter of doing something new and going forward with something that might disrupt the existing ecosystem or deciding that the best approach is to put your shoulder to an existing wheel and build upon what has been been built ... the best course is generally going to be the latter, but there are a LOT of existing wheels and you should be extremely careful and quite discriminating in terms of deciding which is the best one. The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
