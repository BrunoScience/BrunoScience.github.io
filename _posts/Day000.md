# 100 Days of learning -- Day 0

We learn in order to become better at the community and processes of learning ... shared practical learning is fundamentally what science is about. Science is a matter of community learning ... we do science in order to engage in the community of science.

Perhaps we should articulate the ANNOTIFY vision ... learning is based upon the scientific method or the community of genuine science -- it's about studying what others have learned, interacting with others and generally leveling up our skills ... as we explain what we have learned to others, we actually learn the material ourselves or we learn facets of a topic that did not originally occur to us ... in general the interactions with scientists and learners is about continously finding better ways to learn from the community of people who are best at learning ... it's not just the topic itself, but improving our ability to learn is about understanding something aobut how/why was the new insight discovered.

The ANNOTIFY app is about learning development workflow ... automating the effectiveness of the structure of curated, annotated, scripted, automated learning.

### You will NEVER finish this pre-requisite lesson from Day 0

> The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings.

Of course, this lesson *should* PRECEED any serious work from the [curated list of AWESOME ***bash*** scripts and resources](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash), ie because before even using a script, you should really understand what you trying to automate and where this is going to end up ... except, of course, as you use scripting you will learn how [your own fluency in mastering the command line](https://github.com/BrunoScience/notes-on-the-art-of-command-line) was and always will be far less than adequate. That is because this skill is fundamentally about trying to be better at learning how the best of several billion humans learn how to learn ... maybe you can almost learn to keep up with the smartest person you know, but this is really about trying to keep up with the smartest group of 1000 or so learners from the very smartest of smart 1,000,000 people you might be able to know.
