# 100 Days of learning about graph compute -- Day 3

This is really about just the basic installation and TRIAL of [QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/documentation/).  We install QUANTUM ESPRESSO from source, which means that need first of all a minimal Unix environment, that is: a command shell (e.g., bash, sh) and utilities make, awk, sed ... for our purposes, we install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and more) using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
