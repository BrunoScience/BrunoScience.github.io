*PATIENCE, please ... this post is under the early, early pre-thinkering stages of construction*

## 100 Days of Podcastering

The *project car* will be a **#100DaysOf______** podcast at Bruno.Science. 

We can joke about calling it a *project car*, because we have sorta *dabbled* in the matter of podcastering before ... not really one bit seriously ... Bruno.Science will be more serious, but we're ***still*** be dabbling. It's dabbling 2.0. Podcastering is an example of something that everyone *should* learn ... it's not something most really **need** to learn though.

## Bruno.Science is the SCIENCE of #100Days0f_______

In order to DEVELOP something that we call ***Podcasting 2.0*** we will embark upon doing this as a **100DaysOfPodcastering** series ... as a template of a rough draft. 

It is only a *project car* for our own self-development ... maybe something to build on; maybe not ... if this goes well, it may turn into a better template for a series of **#100DaysOf______** podcasts at Bruno.Science.

## The Template So Far for #100DaysOf________ 

1) Sketch out the general working outline of the plan for 100 days ... realizing, of course, that the specific working outline is going to change and eveb possibly change each day ... but on day one, the deliverable of your learning project needs to be somewhat scoped project statement and an outline of roughly how you see the next 100 days ... at first, you might just see the plan in 10 or 15 milestones unfolding over approximately 100 days, but you should have enough granularity in those milestones to have some inkling of how much effort will be needed ... working with intention means that you need INTENTION; you need more than *just* doing it ... if you want to work smarter, you must THINK concretely, in at least a written or sketched outline that you can share with others, about what you are going to *just* do. It does not need to be formal or polished, but a plan needs to be CONCRETE and sharable.

2) We will work entirely in public ... if you jump down to step 21, you will see that we start releasing content for others via social media. Now, before we jump into the remainder of the first 20 days which laying foundation before *going public* with this plant, we should do a deep dive into what exactly is laying involved in the foundation ... before going public on day 21. At a minimum you should develop a content creation, revise that copy approximately seven days later, complete a second revision about 14 days later and make the final script for recording a podcast 20-21 days later.  In other words, working in public requires being more prepared and concrete ... it's really about FOCUS and VISUALIZED INTENTION, so that we are ready to get input from the public as we rehearse ... but as we see in the next step, even the content creation, collaboration and revision processes will be in public. This is about reinforcing the discipline of INTENTION. INTENTION in collaboration. INTENTION in the final deliverable. 

3) As a general rule you will want to develop the content in some form of a collaborative online workspace ... that means Github Codespaces or GitPod.io or VScode.dev or some other browser-accessible, standard collaborative workspace that anyone with internet access can use  ... well, almost anyone ... this might involve training people somewhat or requesting that they [take their own deep dive into social Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive) as a precondition or prerequisite for collaboration.

20) Social media and social coding are about generating interactions and sharing ideas ... it's tough to say exactly where is the best place to find people, but you won't find people in your imagination or by just continuing to listen to the same people that you have listened to ... you will need to find your own ways to meet people ... it's like kindergarten; get out there and play with those kids ... and BE KIND!

80) This milestone is about the final push toward wrapping thing thing up ... after the 100 days are done, it's either a matter of doing something new and going forward with something that might disrupt the existing ecosystem or deciding that the best approach is to put your shoulder to an existing wheel and build upon what has been been built ... the best course is generally going to be the latter, but there are a LOT of existing wheels and you should be extremely careful and quite discriminating in terms of deciding which is the best one. The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
