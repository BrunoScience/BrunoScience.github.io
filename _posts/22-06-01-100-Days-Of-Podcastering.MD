*PATIENCE, please ... this post is under the early, early pre-thinkering stages of construction*

## 100 Days of Podcastering

The *project car* will be a **#100DaysOf______** podcast at Bruno.Science. 

We can joke about calling it a *project car*, because we have sorta *dabbled* in the matter of podcastering before ... not really one bit seriously ... Bruno.Science will be more serious, but we're ***still*** be dabbling. It's dabbling 2.0. Podcastering is an example of something that everyone *should* learn ... it's not something most really **need** to learn though.

## Bruno.Science is the SCIENCE of #100Days0f_______

In order to DEVELOP something that we call ***Podcasting 2.0*** we will embark upon doing this as a **100DaysOfPodcastering** series ... as a template of a rough draft. 

It is only a *project car* for our own self-development ... maybe something to build on; maybe not ... if this goes well, it may turn into a better template for a series of **#100DaysOf______** podcasts at Bruno.Science.

## The Template So Far for #100DaysOf________ 

1) Podcastering 2.0 ***starts*** with collaboraton and collaborative environments. We will use GitHub [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace) in this first #100DaysOf______ series.

We are not recreating another podcast that we already like ... we are doing this to sketch out the development of Podcastering 2.0 ... it's not intended to be a final release 2.0 ... but it is an exploration of where we see the realm of podcastering fitting in to our particular purpose of ***keeping up with the literature AND improving the peer-review process*** of Science. 

To reiterate, we are not doing this to re-create a better version of some great podcast we wanted to listen to in the past ... the WHOLE method of doing the content is release 2.0. 

By the time you come across this, 2022 will be at least half-way into the rear-view mirror ... this is for maybe 2025 and beyond ... we believe that the whole process of creating and peer-reviewing sciencific content is going to NEED TO BE significantly MORE transparent than anything from either the existing peer-review process or the best of Podcastering 1.0 you are seeing now. 

We believe that in Podcasting 2.0, the host will NEED to collaboratively develop an agenda to talk about [in some sort of collaborative environment that is browser-based or OS-independent] before we record the podcast to talk about the items and content repositories on that agenda ... it's like PapersWithCode ... except that we still find value in a back-and-forth discussion between peers, reviewers, before we get close to a presentation via podcast.

We continue to believe that somewhat final podcasts will be useful thing for people to listen to ... while working out, while gardening, while birdwatching or relaxing at the end of the day ... but those podcasts should be annoated outlines with links to allow people to drill down later into something of particular interest.

2) Before we jump in, let's get an quick idea of what we are jumping into ... [examine the gist of how collaborative Codespaces are used for five minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) ... it's not JUST Codespaces ... we think that this is the general direction for all things creative ... of course, we will also talk about OTHER competing environments ... but to get started we will look at GitHub's Codespaces ... laying the foundation of the collaborative environment for content creation and revision will carry over for the first 20 podcasts.
