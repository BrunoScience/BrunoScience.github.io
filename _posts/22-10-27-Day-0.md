# 100 Days of learning -- Day 0

Articulate ANNOTIFY ... the structure of curated, annotated, scripted, automated learning.

### You will NEVER finish this pre-requisite lesson from Day 0

> The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings.

Of course, this lesson *should* PRECEED any serious work from the [curated list of AWESOME ***bash*** scripts and resources](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash), ie because before even using a script, you should really understand what you trying to automate and where this is going to end up ... except, of course, as you use scripting you will learn how [your own fluency in mastering the command line](https://github.com/BrunoScience/notes-on-the-art-of-command-line) was and always will be far less than adequate. That is because this skill is fundamentally about trying to be better at learning how the best of several billion humans learn how to learn ... maybe you can almost learn to keep up with the smartest person you know, but this is really about trying to keep up with the smartest group of 1000 or so learners from the very smartest of smart 1,000,000 people you might be able to know.
