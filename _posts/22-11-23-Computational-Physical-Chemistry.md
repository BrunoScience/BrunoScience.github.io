*“The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.”*
― Wolfgang Pauli

# Continuously learning about how we can learn better

Science is fundamentally about misunderstanding things and discovering and correcting the misunderstanding ... it's about ALWAYS learning and accepting that the science is never settled.  

If we are serious about learning how we can learn better, then *maybe we can still something about why we do science!*  It's not just about ***learning*** but learning something about how we learn from our previous misunderstanding -- learning is about testing our knowledge. For example, we are interested in finding out exactly what was it in our understanding of *first principles* led to our misunderstanding.

NONE of us really *misunderstand* Physical Chemistry, but some of the better misunderstandings are actually, remarkably pretty damned useful. But, for others of us [outside the professional discipline], we have some work to do to get our misunderstanding of the topic to a deep enough level so that what we think we know can come close to being useful. 

There's a LOT to learn. When we forget our lessons in humility ... we will be schooled in that topic. The first thing to know is that what we think we know is a misunderstanding ... as the Buddhists say, "*Regard all of the dharma as a dream.*"

In spite of our characterizing our scientific knowledge as misunderstanding ... *that scientific knowledge IS the best we have!* ... and, in spite of it being flawed, that human knowledge is still useful in ways that are pretty powerful when it comes to fixing things well enough that our species can survive a bit longer and we might be able to get to a deeper and more useful level of misunderstanding.

Learning and improving upon that knowledge a constant effort ... a labor of LOVE ... science is motivated by a LOVE of the fundamental nature of Reality and WHY we are alive. 

## The *CROWDLINESS* of science

The love, motivation and drive are strong enough that we humans not only do science but we look for ways to help us do science better ... and we have found all kinds of ways ... especially powerful are the ways that allow us to share the improvements ... this started with things like scientific journals, but it has advanced remarkably with things like the world wide web and all kinds of developments in information technology and containerized collaborative scientific notebooks.

We humans not only employ machines to handle the more tedious aspects of the effort for us ... we have made those networks of machines smarter and much more capable ... it USED TO BE that we could drive to universities or fly to conferences to interact with peers ... but NOW we have to use the virtual realm to stay in contact with our peers doing science around the world. If there was any doubt about this before, 2020 and the covid restrictions effectively PROVED that human interaction is more efficient, more effective when humans are asynchronously engaged in work in the virtual realm. 

This means that ALL of us, will have an enormous amount of work to do just keeping up with what others have accomplished.

Science, like any advanced productive human activity, is no longer a one Newton alone in his laboratory kind of thing ... it's also no longer a matter of worker bees commuting to be in their cubicles so that their habits and workflow discipline can be constantly programmed into their subconcious. Science now, not only involves more people working at above Newton's level, but they are working with far more powerful tools AND they are collaborating with peers around the globe. 

***Accepting the virtual crowdliness of asynchronous workflows of modern science is another facet of the humility required to do science now.***

The larger network of networks of humans advancing science and advancing the effectiveness of information technology means that whatever we knew one second ago is not dated or has been superseded by some improvement, ie  in a universal sense, it's a matter of `sudo dnf update && sudo dnf upgrade` *for all of our distros ... and there's not really much tolerance for SciOps developers who insist on using last year's infrastructure-as-code*.

Humans who believe that they understand something not only don't ... if they really BELIEVE that, they are DEAD, ie they've stopped learning.

As long as humans are ALIVE, humans do science in order to have a better or more useful understanding about something -- the improvement of misunderstanding [of science] is how humankind learns how to learn.

## An exercise in learning something about why we do science

This particular little exercise is 100-day guided deep dive into the particular topic of [*ab initio* or "from first principles" computational chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) ... if we take this exercise seriously, we will learn about our limits ... we will be humbled, probably on a daily basis, by how little we actually understand.

*THAT humility is what we WANT!!!*

In order really *understand* physical chemistry and quantum mechanics, we will improve upon the abilities to simulate how material properties come into being ... the accuracy of our simulations will be useful for solving various problems in the invention of new technologies and processes -- but mostly, we will learn WHY our simulations are not quite good enough.

Perhaps, the important part of the whole exercise is in verifying that our computational simulations *ALMOST* match actual real world data but, most importantly, finding out how where our understanding is flawed, ie ***REAL information*** does not come from affirmation, but rather comes out of what surprises us and motivates us to change our approach.

 [Computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) might extend to optimizing [**Physics-informed** neural networks (PINN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/theory/phys_informed.html) to be more efficient in searching for or identifying compounds with properties we desire ... but the WHY of the exercise is understanding the first principles or assumptions upon which physical chemistry is based.

 Human understanding of physical chemistry is imperfect ... but we learn how to learn better in order to learn how that misunderstanding is flawed ... ***science is fundamentally about the LOVE of human misunderstanding.***

### Computational material science or computational physical chemistry is a serious topic.

It is serious because ***the people who choose to do THIS do IT because doing IT is what they have chosen to DO with their lives. Doing THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***
### 100 Days of learning about executable graph compute workflows ... to use *ab initio* quantum chemistry methods

It's 100 Days of learning about everything we need to do make executable graph computing happen.

In order to do this *practically* ... we will apply our Physics-informed machine learning approaches to the realm of *ab initio* or "from first principles" quantum chemistry computation and/or physics-informed neural networks (PINN).

In some sense, this deep dive might seem like it's about chemistry ... the particular topic of [*ab initio* quantum physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) ... but that theoretical background is only important because of how it might help us do [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) ... maybe, our approach might be more data science driven, but even then the physical chemistry background still helps us optimize [**Physics-informed** neural networks (PINN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/theory/phys_informed.html) ... but even THAT misses the point ... this deep dive is fundamentally about the SOCIAL or collaborative aspect of science.  In order to be more efficient in searching for or identifying compounds with properties we desire, it's MOST important to do this WITH OTHER COLLABORATORS ... with the larger scientific community -- but it's not about some nebulous view of community ... what IS *community* after all.  

This is REAL ... about REAL science and *real science about the REAL specific human beings who share some common values ... it's about REAL human beings and the entire thrust of REAL LIVES which are primarily about being engaged in this quest for practical scientific knowledge.*  People who do this probably do not do it in order to be able to afford nice gadgets or a comfortable home ... ***people who do THIS do IT because IT is what they do and THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***

In the end ... it's mostly about the ***discipline*** of continuously learning about learning and it is this DISCIPLINE which makes this THIS is a serious, consequential topic.  It matters to the individuals, to the REAL scientists doing it. It is serious because ***the people who choose to do THIS do IT because doing IT is what they DO. Doing THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***


## Learning is about graphs, about REALLY *connecting* the dots

We want the executable compute graph of something, we want to know how to put it into practice ... this means going beyond simply learning what word means or how something works ... we want our simulations to be meaningful and accurate ... we want the digital twin of something to approach being a digital clone.

This mean that our understanding must be operational, functional, executable ... so we must learn ***the GRAPH*** of a topic ... and since we use machines, it's about learning the ***compute graph*** of a topic.  To achieve that, we will need to learn the human knowledge graph, the commitgraph of who's made what commit to the body of knowledge and what impact that commit has had ... and we also want to understand something about where the body of knowledge seems to be going, so we will want to understand the social graph of a topic, especially if we are contrarians or skeptics ... LEARNING is about how people, knowledge, topics, things relate to one another **and where the gaps are** ... ***LEARNING is about really CONNECTING the dots AND understanding where the connections are imprecise or shabby.***


Learning about learning is about learning how to level up skills as we go along ... not just how to test, experiment and learn -- but how the best practices in testing, experimentation and learning are improving in near realtime as we learn them.  We want to develop the skills of learning faster about things that can make one more productive. Active learning of this nature is fundamentally an exercise in the continuous improvement of diligent dogfooding -- we are mostly learning in order to learn in order to learn in order to learn ...  we use deep learning and computational horsepower to aid our learning about other things like computational chemistry and simulation, AI for computer-aided imaging at nanoscale and natural language processing for smarter ways to curate and annotate datagraphs of knowledge.

In the end ... it's mostly about the ***discipline*** of continuously learning about learning.



## The #100Days Plan 

0)  [WHY are we learning](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/27/Day-0.html) ... the internet has changed education and science forever. Learning NOW is necessarily about understanding the competition and advance in the best practices of learning. The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings. We learn [about science or learning] in large part because learning or science is ***fundamentally*** social activity ... ***without other engaging other humans, there's no point in doing science.

1)  [Setting Up The Learning Sandbox](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/27/Day-1.html) ... BEFORE we start using the BIG rentable computing horsepower, let's spend some time figuring out how this stuff works and WHY we might actually need multi-node GPU clusters for a problem, ie so that we don't just squander our capital buying time for something that doesn't need it.

2) [Dev Workflow and Kernel profiling](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-2.html) ... we build a supercomputing workflow ... that means containers and something that we can take to a much, much, much more powerful machine. 

3) [Setting the stage for computational simulation](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-3.html) will involve taking a bit of dive into the pool of [computational chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) and [computational chemistry software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_chemistry_and_solid-state_physics_software) ... we want to think about [scalable workflows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00638-4)

4) [Preparations for using a packages like QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-4.html) To install [QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/documentation/) from source, we will need first of all a minimal Unix environment, that is: a command shell (e.g., bash, sh) and utilities make, awk, sed ... for our purposes, we install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and more) using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
