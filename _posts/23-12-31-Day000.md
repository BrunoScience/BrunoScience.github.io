“*The BEST that any of us can hope to achieve in science is simply to* ***misunderstand*** *at a deeper level.*”

― Wolfgang Pauli

# We develop open source systems FOR HOBBYISTS to better accomplish the goals of scientific exploration

Hobbyists have always done serious science and it is necessary that hobbyists remain skeptical and sometimes remind people that all scientists must necessarily be extremely skeptical of our current level of understanding. The BEST scientists are skeptics; the most DANGEROUS scientists are those who too willing to believe that any form science is ever settled. We do not ***misunderstand*** *at a deep enough, profound enough level yet.

We continue to do science out of gratitude, to better appreciate the Universe that is being created for us, so that we might better understand our role, perhaps to be better stewards of that creation ... but mostly to better appreciate the awesome greatness of our Universe.

***The HUMILITY of modern scientific collaboration drives the WHY of our interest in developing better systems for scientific exploration.***

***[Development communities or organizations [including research institutions and business organizations] which seek to develop scientific systems are NECESSARILY constrained to produce systems which are shaped by the communication structures and workflows of these communities or organizations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law).*** 

Since the entire goal in this effort is to serve hobbyists, we will build open source systems that will look very familiar to those who are well-versed in the [architecture of open source applications](https://aosabook.org/en/index.html).  As a matter of principle, **we strongly believe that the best way to serve the general aim of science is through open source systems** ... and development efforts that shaped by the communication structures and workflows of open source development communities.
