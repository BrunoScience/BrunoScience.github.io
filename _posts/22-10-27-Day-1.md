# 100 Days of learning -- Day 1

There's simply no end to the amount of *"sharpening the saw"* that is NECESSARY for your personal sysadmin tools in information technology ... get used to the fact that you simply can never know enough in this realm. It is now old news that software has eaten the world; you should also understand why data has replace capital and deep learning in a hybrid machine + human skill has become the dominant force in [self-]education. 

Automating your intelligence gathering with personal sysadmin toools is fundamentally about time management ... using machines effectively to give yourself enough time to relax and think ... optimizing every second of every day.

This means that things like [*fluency on the command line*](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) has become absolutely essential prerequisite skill for all kinds of learning and communication nowadays ... without this fluency, you will essentially be relegated to being able to only be a consumer of pre-digested information that others feel like passing along -- you will be *spoon fed* re-gurgitated information dished up for the harvested masses.

You will probably want to develop your own repository of [notes on mastering the command line](https://github.com/BrunoScience/notes-on-the-art-of-command-line) and possibly contribute to the [main repository](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line]. The point of developing your own selection of notes and tips on using the command-line is to more effectively be in control of your own tools by continually *"sharpening this saw"*. 

### You will NEVER finish this pre-requisite lesson from Day 1

> The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings.

Of course, this lesson *should* PRECEED any serious work from the [curated list of AWESOME ***bash*** scripts and resources](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash), ie because before even using a script, you should really understand what you trying to automate and where this is going to end up ... except, of course, as you use scripting you will learn how [your own fluency in mastering the command line](https://github.com/BrunoScience/notes-on-the-art-of-command-line) was and always will be far less than adequate. That is because this skill is fundamentally about trying to be better at learning how the best of several billion humans learn how to learn ... maybe you can almost learn to keep up with the smartest person you know, but this is really about trying to keep up with the smartest group of 1000 or so learners from the very smartest of smart 1,000,000 people you might be able to know.
