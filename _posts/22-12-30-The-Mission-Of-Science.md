*“The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.”*
― Wolfgang Pauli

"All I want to do is to misunderstand the right things at a deeper level ... I have no interest whatsoever in understanding the COMFORT of having no faith, giving up on my mission, avoiding the conversation with my Creator." -- me

# Science is necessarily a beautiful artform, a conversation about intensely practical principles of knowledge that we can have with our Creator

Science is all about why God set IT up that way.

If you don't like the use of the word God ... ***get the living fuck over the language!*** 

God is ... BY DEFINITION ... not a matter of faith, but by DEFINITIOIN ... *by definition*, God is the *thing* that set everything in motion ... the *thing* that set up laws that govern ALL Reality and ALL instances of Reality.  It's NOT about anthropomorhizing God; what is LUDICROUS is that humans imagining that they can possibly ever achieve some sort of knowledge parity with that which created this Universe and the laws governing all Universes ... so if you are familiar with the different variation on the [old cosmic turtle story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Turtle) ... God is simply THE WORD we use to describe the *turtle* that is holding up the world ... G - 0 - D ... simple semiotics ...  ***get the living fuck over being triggered by someone's the language!***  ***Master*** *your own ego, before you try to master language of other beings.*

# Science is all about why God set EVERYTHING and EVERY last law that governs the behavior of EVERY LAST THING up the way it is.

Doing Science is something that HAS now become a vocation within the reach of NEW billions ... these are NEWLY enabled people ... the BILLIONS who could not imagine even sending their kids off to college decade ago ... also amoung the NEWLY enabled are still-capable, physically-active retirees, who gave up on their scientific career decades ago in order to make money, save the family farm or do other things ... there's not really an end to the number of people who can now do science ... but there IS a definite limit on the number of people who can reach the point where they will trust their imagination enough to be able to have that converstation with their Creator. 

The productivity of computational tools to do science is an true EMBARRASSMENT of riches ... with our high bandwidth communication networks, model/data hubs, pre-print archives of papers with code and the increasing tendency of scientist to communicate in a language like Python rather than English, we can also asynchronoously leverage our networks of crowds of scienctist interested in the same niche topics around the global ... we have better institutional mechanisms and market alternatives which allow for efficient-coordination and sharing capital-intensive resources, eg information has routed around transportation bottlenecks -- it's no longer necessary to own a vehicle or even to depend upon an automotive taxi or trucks to enable commuter travelling or the transport of deliveries in nations where ride-sharing is enabled by AI and cellular networks.

Science is knowledge manufacturing, knowledge mining, knowledge construction, knowledge farming ... but science is fundamentally about extending the body of practical, useful knowledge that helps us more efficiently exploit the opportunities before us in our Universe.

Science does NOT require much in the way of physical ability, eg consider the achievements of a person like Stephen Hawking ... although there plenty of forms of science that are all about physiology, resilient health, extreme fitness/performance in which those with physical abilities can apply their talents.

Science is also something that can be done at an extremely high level by any scientist, regardless of the scientist's age, basically up until almost the moment that scientist dies.

Science is increasingly computational and involves increasingly automated, well-designed experiments ... and we are not at the point in our history where we face an EMBARRASSMENT of riches ... through the *magic* of better ways to scale or share resources ... of course, we have seen the remarkable growth of this *embarrassment* in the computational realm ... but we have also seen in the available of data, models and a host of ways to crowdsource our experimental trials and piggyback upon what others are doing ... of course, we also have seen an increasing array of open source, extensible, highly-affordable and insanely intelligent lab automation equipment.

***If YOU want to do science, but YOU imagine that YOU cannot possibly have the support, means, wherewithall to do serious science ... the problem is with YOUR imagination.***

You don't need ACRES of ground to do science. You don't need factories. You don't need much in the way of resources that you own / control ... MOST of doing science is now about IMAGINATION and using what has been missed by the crowd.

Doing serious science in the exact realm that you want to do that science is within your reach ... but YOU are going to have to avoid being stymied by your failure of imagination.

You have to realize that imagination is not a gift, it is a DISCIPLINE ... and as a DISCIPLINE, it is something that must be trained *WITH INTENTION*, studied, developed, improved and advanced each day ... if you fail to imagine how you can achieve something -- the failure in imagination is ENTIRELY a matter of YOU failing to develop your DISCIPLINE and to TRAIN WITH INTENTIION.

## TRAINING with INTENTION

The BIGGEST resource constraint in the world is not arable acres ...  also not minerals, natural resources, or physical resources ... the binding constraint is also not in the absence of navigable waterways, railroads or pipelines to move physical resources ... the BIGGEST constraint is in the lack of imagination, especially in the lack of imagination to find ways around seeming constraints. There's ALWAYS a way around constraints ... but most of the time, IDIOTS quit and give up when they hit a constraint or some sort of wall ... instead of finding some sort of way to flank to get around the constraint ... EVERY constraint encountered is any opportunity to develop one's creativity and to find little ways around the constraint.

Training with INTENTION is all about the intention to persevere in order to develop the discipline necessary as a foundation for imagination to appear *from nowhere*. You cannot reap if you do now sow the seeds ... training WITH INTENTION is about developing the INTENTION or stubborness to quit on the right things.

You SHOULD quit on things [and people] that have worked at proving they are not worth your time ... you should not enable egos ... you should quit on certain things, so that you never quit on your general mission ... even though, you should be child-like in how you view that mission ... the mission is something given to you by your Creator -- it's not something that is a product of your ego, your reputation, your standing as a professional ... your mission is something that you know you must do, but you will almost never know exactly how you should accomplish that mission ... your Creator gave you a mission in order to get you to train with intention, to develop humility and to discover what the mission is.

***Therefore, TRAINING with INTENTIION is all about the stubborn intent to discern your Creator's intent.*** The essence of being a warrior is to never quit on your mission ... the essence of being a warrior has nothing to do with egotistically *as a matter of pride* imagining that you are qualified to pick the mission ... *never quitting on your mission is about staying alert, focused, intent on learning about the mission as you go along.*

Developing the disipline of imagination is all about planting lots of viable seeds based on the development of rationally coherent theories ... FIRST OF ALL, you have to read and do lots of homework and roll up your sleeves and *learn the hard way* in order to just understand the state of the art in any body of theoretical knowledge ... you get no credit whatsoever for claiming to be professional or claiming to be scientifically-minded if you do not put in the time READING, sketching out your ideas, testing your understanding, doing the homework, networking with people who work in the scientific realm you are interested in ... FIRST OF ALL, in order to be a scientist, you must become like a very humble, very ordinary, beginning level student ... MOST people ... especially anyone over 30 [or maybe even younger], simply cannot ditch their ego and become humble enough in their command of the knowledge to be a decent student. *Most failures of imagingation are actually failures of humility or needing to feed one's ego.*

The NEXT part of imagination is in the EFFICIENT design of experiments to test multiple things at once, eg you NEED to understand what *orthogonal arrays* are, although the terminology for this matters ... efficient experimental design is based upon being able to learn multiple lessons efficiently from a set of experiments ... it's NOT just throwing mud at the wall to see what sticks OR persistently just squandering resources with a trial and error approach.  If you want to imagine EFFICIENTLY ... you need to understand how/why orthogonal arrays work.

Teardown and analysis of failures is NECESSARY to do science ... it's not just analyzing what failed ... it's also about trying to be observant to discover things that could not have been foreseen ... analysis of failure is entirely about imagination and thinking outside of the box ... RATHER than producing results for someone funding the research ... IMAGINATIVE science is about producting a result that was not foreseen by the investigator or anyone paying for the experiment.  Therefore, MOST of science involves looking over what has been missed by others ... that is a partly matter of imagination, but it is mostly a matter of being more efficient in gathering intell ... the biggest gains in artificial intelligence are not in the realm of what is expected ... but in the crossover application of things that were not expected ... in other words, the CROWDLY nature of science now requires training with INTENTION to study what the other guy has learned AND also what the other guy has missed.
