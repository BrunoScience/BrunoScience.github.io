# 100 Days of learning -- Day 15

This is mostly conversion of social graphs and knowledge graphs into APPLIED algorithms for HPC ... maybe it's about webinars, screencasting, peer programming while running SLURM in a rentable compute setting ... GitHub repos of workflows run on AWS, Azure, GCP, vast.ai, et al ... the ***application domain*** has to drive the code ... but the code needs to compile and run in available compute environments.
