# 100 Days of learning -- Day 19

[SOMEBODY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTav7r38y-Y) ... or maybe [somebody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6HJi0iqYbw) really should have a ***rentable*** compute / AI training workstation for their Patreon subscribers.

There's an audience of people who might have a $100, $200, $500 or $1000/month budget for some **serious** compute time ... maybe WE are part of that audience ... we take our **science** or **graph compute** hobby seriously or at least seriously enough that we have a SMALL budget to feed our aspirations of developing or leveling-up our skillset ... but our SMALL budget is not going to be more than $1000/month -- it might not even be $100/month ... but we will need *some time* on genuinely powerful workstations, but we do not really need *24x365 always-immediately-available mission-critical business-level* time, although we might want that for our little learning sandboxes ... so why isn't [some tech who builds systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hxr9k5Vdc4) offering time [by the day, hour or minute] on something like a $1,000,000 monster workstation as a $2500/day or $100/hr reservable, possibly interruptible service.
