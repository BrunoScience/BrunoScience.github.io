# 100 Days of learning about graph compute workflows and *ab initio* quantum chemistry methods

The general objective of this deep dive is about [*ab initio* quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) and [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) and that means not just learning, but really LEARNING about how to test, experiment and learn as we go ... to develop the skills of learning faster about things that can make one more productive. Active learning of this nature is fundamentally an exercise in the continuous improvement of diligent dogfooding -- we are mostly learning in order to learn in order to learn in order to learn ...  we use deep learning and computational horsepower to aid our learning about other things like computational chemistry and simulation, AI for computer-aided imaging at nanoscale and natural language processing for smarter ways to curate and annotate datagraphs of knowledge ... it's mostly about the discipline of continuously learning about learning.

We think of learning as a form of informed search, not JUST computer-aided search, but computer-aided search of a graph execution framework which includes computational tools, workflows, data, reproducible code, [peer-reviewed] papers and annotated review/discussion which can rapidly inform how we learn or what we spend our time learning ... informed search thus envolves using machines to crawl over a directed acyclical graph database and humans to dig into the details and then take further steps to learn.   

We might learn best by first having a general overview of the lay of the land and THEN using search to dig in and target our efforts as to how and where we should expend the effort doing things the hard way to learn. So informed search is the part of learning that we might be most interested in trying to improve FIRST, because it sets the stage for what we learn NEXT. Since we are interested in [informed search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#Informed_search), we think in terms of [the wide array of graph algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms) such as the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). 

However, we don't really want to dive deep into the weeds on all of these algorithms right away since our main interest is about developing AI computing platform tools for biological imaging devices, so our interest is somewhat bounded by what we need to use in order to [use the Holoscan software development kit](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara-holoscan/sdk-user-guide/clara_holoscan_devguide.html) and [relevant technologies]](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara-holoscan/sdk-user-guide/relevant_technologies.html#relevant-technologies) to create the next-generation of streaming applications for AI-enabled biological imaging devices with real-time AI inference and fast IO.

Thus, the point of doing this 100 day dive into graph compute is to PRACTICALLY experiment with the general approach of using [compute graphs](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara-holoscan/sdk-user-guide/gxf/index.html) for modularity and extensibility of at the application level to aggressively apply better AI/ML techniques to the cause of better knowledge.

*In general, as humans we use machines to help us use more date to better inform or speed our search for knowledge* ... this can be as banal as just googling keywords to learn how a word is spelled or maybe an acronym definition  ... but as we become more adept, machine-equipped search for knowledge rapidly takes us into the world of GPUs, TPUs, IPUs, AI accelerators and technologies that we cannot even obtain yet.  

We can begin [during these 100 days] comparing the evolving offerings of Paperspace, Lambda, VAST.ai, Colab, Kaggle, GCP, Azure, AWS ... along the way, the dive into informed search algorithms will require a bit of leveling-up or *de-rustification* of old school skills in IT sysadmin and C++ libraries as well as just trying to keep up with what's happening in containers, Jupyter notebooks, Python, PyTorch


## The #100Days Plan 

1)  [Setting Up The Learning Sandbox](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/27/Day-1.html) ... BEFORE we start using the BIG rentable computing horsepower, let's spend some time figuring out how this stuff works and WHY we might actually need multi-node GPU clusters for a problem, ie so that we don't just squander our capital buying time for something that doesn't need it.

2) [Dev Workflow and Kernel profiling](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-2.html) ... we build a supercomputing workflow ... that means containers and something that we can take to a much, much, much more powerful machine. 

3) [Setting the stage for computational simulation](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-3.html) will involve taking a bit of dive into the pool of [computational chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) and [computational chemistry software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_chemistry_and_solid-state_physics_software) ... we want to think about [scalable workflows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00638-4)

4) [Preparations for using a packages like QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/10/28/Day-4.html) To install [QUANTUM ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/documentation/) from source, we will need first of all a minimal Unix environment, that is: a command shell (e.g., bash, sh) and utilities make, awk, sed ... for our purposes, we install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and more) using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
