# 100 Days of learning -- Day 0

We do science in order to engage in the larger community of *pure* science ... this is not exactly the Big Science world of academia, research instiutions, industry and government, which is about money, empires and careers.  We do *pure* science in order to learn, to learn how to learn scientifically, to learn how knowledge advances and in order to become better at the larger internetworked community and the processes of learning at massive scale ... the culture and social aspect of shared practical learning is fundamentally what *pure* science is about. Of course, *pure* science is about very real, very practical things ... but doing *pure* science is a matter of understanding, following and doing the research ... participating in scientific community, not for empire building, but ***PURELY for LEARNING. ***

Learning is based upon the scientific method or the larger super-community of pure, genuine science -- it's not about politicking or empire-building or getting grants ... it is about the JOY and LOVE of the scientific community ... about studying what others have learned, interacting with others who love discovering new things and generally leveling up everyone skills ... just as we learn best when explain what we have learned to others, we actually learn the material ourselves or we learn facets of a topic that did not originally occur to us when we use a computational approach or use machines to automate our [group] learning processes.

In addition to fully exploiting the network effects of scientific communities, niches, sub-disciplines, we also exploit computational power and uses of computational power such as deep learning or HPC simulations. Computation, AI and advances in HPC technologies are about improving our ability to deeply learn or to *misunderstand* at a deeper level ... the intention of the whole effort is to find surprises.  REAL information is about SURPRISE, not affirmation.

We do embrace the discipline of using an infrastructure-as-code philosophy ... this SciOps dev workflow is really about being able to share results and interact with a focus on the science [rather than on whether someone's getting different results because their machine is set up different] ... SciOps involves automating the effectiveness of the structure of curated, annotated, scripted, automated learning -- so we use tools like Jupyter and Python because OTHER people use these things for exploratory analysis ... SciOps is about making the community interactions mostly about the pure science, RATHER than about the set-up or installation or dependencies or debugging someone's system.

Mostly, our reason for wanting *to just get into it* is about more rapidly discovering where our misunderstandings are causing difficulties ...  we want push our knowledge until it breaks and fails ... anything that humans doing with serious or intensity is all about failing ... not being a comfortable spectator, but more rapidly being humiliated by how little we actually understand.

### You will NEVER finish this pre-requisite lesson from Day 0

> The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings.
