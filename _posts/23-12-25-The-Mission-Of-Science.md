*“The best that most of us can hope to achieve in Physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.”*
― Wolfgang Pauli

The [LAUNCH of the JWST on December 25, 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_James_Webb_Space_Telescope) was certainly a big event, but the larger timeline furnishes an example of how much planning, extra effort in brand new technology development and just execution of the original visions goes into serious scientific projects, even ones that are not as large as JWST.

When things work, as  they did with JWST, it also shows us why the larger campaign of space exploration is so unending and infinite ... yes, there are immediate results of tiny little things like GPS for navigation to satellite telecommunications or space defense programs ... but most of the effort in space explorations and new experiments in Physics is incomprehensibly gigantic, especially for most people who never really do anything more than a few miles away ... but the exploration development of new even more useful technologies will never finish. So, it applies to everything, *the best that most of us can hope to achieve in science exploration is simply to* ***misunderstand*** *at a deeper level.”*
