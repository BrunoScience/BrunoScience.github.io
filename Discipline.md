# Daily Compounding

Discipline is about sticking at it on a DAILY basis.

Not just going through the motions, but also about meta-discipline and owning the responsibility for controlling our mind ... this means that we try to never let up, but to constantly work *with diligent* ***intention***  ... as we focus upon continuously improving the intelligence and execution of our discipline. 

The maniacal focus on improving the discipline drives us to think about better stick at sticking with it ... discipline is recursiveAF ... it has to be ... 

## Discipline Equals Freedom

*Here's the plan ...*

0)  [WHY](https://brunoscience.github.io/100days/2022/12/31/Day000.html) ... the internet has changed education and science forever. Learning NOW is necessarily about understanding the competition and advance in the best practices of learning. The meta-lesson of this lesson is about the humility of learning from other human beings. We learn [about science or learning] in large part because learning or science is ***fundamentally*** social activity ... ***without other engaging other humans, there's no point in doing science.

20) Social media and social coding are about generating interactions and sharing ideas ... it's tough to say exactly where is the best place to find people, but you won't find people in your imagination or by just continuing to listen to the same people that you have listened to ... you will need to find your own ways to meet people ... it's like kindergarten; get out there and play with those kids ... and BE KIND!

The process of learning something should have introduced you to the people in the world who are the very best at what can be achieved. If you genuinely don't believe these people are capable of realizing the best vision of what is possible, you disrupt ... but the best option is likely going to be continued collaboration and evangelization for success.
