# Daily Compounding

Discipline is about sticking at it on a DAILY basis.

Discipline is also about meta-discipline, ie, working with intention upon our discipline to better stick at sticking with it.

Yes, topics will seem impenetrably HARD, but if we can somehow just bang away, get a good night's rest and let our subconscious make sense of things, we can get a teensy amount smarter or maybe something like 1% smarter every day ... when we do this consisently, we can maybe get 6% smarter every week, which will still seem barely noticable ... but when we do this over time, will be about 2X as smart in 12 weeks, which actually IS noticable.
